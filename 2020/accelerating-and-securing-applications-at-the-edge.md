**Presented by Peter Brecl**

In today’s digital economy, the underlying applications and workflows that power organizations must be agile, secure and perform in an optimal manner. As workloads and data move closer to end users, development teams battle legacy infrastructures that are inflexible and unable to scale – slowing down innovation, constricting development cycles and reducing application security and performance. To accelerate and secure modern web experiences, we must rethink how we deploy end-to-end application defenses, ensuring availability and application layer security. Learn how containerized environments can be service-chained to build out a multilayered security policy, giving organizations the flexibility to customize security stacks across best-in-breed WAF, bot management and API protection solutions while delivering policies tailored to individual workflows.
