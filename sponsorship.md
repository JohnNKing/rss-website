    <p>The Rochester Security Summit is a focal point for information security in New York and surrounding areas. In collaboration with our sponsor partners, the Summit attracts high quality speakers, provides opportunities for education and outreach, and serves a largely technical audience interested in security policies, products, and services. This year, the Summit will again be in the Rochester Convention Center. We expect over 400 attendees in this attractive, convenient, and larger venue.</p>

	<p>The Summit has excellent representation across industries and job functions. In 2018, the profile of paid Summit attendees was as follows:</p>
