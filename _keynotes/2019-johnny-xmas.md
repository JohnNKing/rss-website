Johnny Xmas is a predominant personality in Information Security, most well-known for his community-building efforts as a founder of BurbSec, and his work on the TSA Master Key leaks. Currently working as a Blade Runner for the Australian bot-hunting firm ‘Kasada’ to defend against the automated abuse of web infrastructure, he was previously a Security Researcher for Uptake’s Industrial Cybersecurity Platform. Prior to this, he spent many years in the field as a penetration tester, focusing heavily on both IT and physical security of financial and medical facilities, and got his start as a Security Engineer for a Fortune 500 Enterprise. He has presented on his work over 100 times in 7 countries since 2003, and is very excited to have finally made his way to the Rochester Security Summit!
