**Presented by Joe Testa**

We will talk about the inner workings of the TLS and SSH protocols and the security properties they offer. Attacks against the TLS protocol versions will be analyzed, along with weak ciphersuites and other options. Similarly, attacks on SSH and various common cryptographic settings will also be discussed. Open-source and free tools will be demonstrated to audit TLS & SSH services. Hardening techniques for achieving optimal security settings for both protocols will be covered in detail.
