layout: page 
---

**Presented by William Malik**

The hybrid cloud now handles much that was formerly done by the in-house IT organization. From an infrastructure and operations perspective however, oversight and management are more challenging than ever. During this talk, we will discuss the elements of conventional I&O that must remain – although transformed – when migrating increasing portions of an organization’s workload to hybrid cloud. We will focus on information security, and in particular the architectural challenge that zero trust places on conventional information security architectures, procedures, staffing, and audit. We will close with some hints and tips to smooth the passage to this superior cybersecurity approach.
