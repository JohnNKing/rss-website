**Presented by Matt DeMatteo**

Data science is already transforming many aspects of our business and personal lives, but many in the cyber security do not know how it will change the industry. In this brief talk, I explain how data science is being used to bridge the gap between the threat intelligence typically leveraged by security platforms and the threat intelligence that human experts use. I quickly explore what makes data science-based detection logic different from Boolean-based detection logic, why practitioners will move away from the SIEM event funnel, and how frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK are critical to creating efficiencies for people and machines.
