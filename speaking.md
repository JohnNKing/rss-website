<h2>Rochester Security 2020 Virtual Events Presentation Proposal</h2>

<p>While we will not be hosting a Rochester Security Summit in 2020, we remain committed to providing opportunities for our community to share in talks, networking and training.</p>

<p>We are, to that end, announcing a special Call for Presentations. These presentation proposals will be considered by our committee for inclusion in a series of virtual events that we will be scheduling throughout the fall of 2020. We invite those who are interested to kindly submit a proposal.</p>
