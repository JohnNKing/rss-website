Each year, during National Cyber Security Awareness Month, the Rochester Security Summit features education opportunities for executives, CFO, CIO/CSO, business managers, security professionals, IT managers, technical specialists, help desk staff, and developers.

In 2012, the Summit gathered more than 200 attendees for 28 outstanding technical presentations -- along with three Ethical Hacking training sessions.
